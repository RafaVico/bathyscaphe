If you want to translate the game to your language you must:

1) Duplicate file "ENGLISH.LANG" (or another language you understand).
2) Change the name to "YOURLANGUAGE.LANG".
3) Update line "@lang" with the name of your language.
4) Update line "@author" with your name.
5) Translate all numbered lines (don't remove the code).

And that's all.
